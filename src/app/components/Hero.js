/*
 * Hero Component
 *
 * Overview:
 * The Hero component is a visually compelling section typically placed at the top of a webpage. It's designed to grab the user's attention immediately upon landing on the page. This component integrates a dynamic gradient background using a canvas element and prominently displays a sign-up form alongside motivational text.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Dynamic Gradient Background: Utilizes the `@bedard/gradient` library to create an animated gradient effect on a canvas element. The colors and seed for the gradient are specified, ensuring a unique and engaging visual experience.
 * - Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring the component is visually appealing on both small and large screens.
 * - Sign-Up Form Integration: Incorporates the `SignUpForm` component, allowing users to sign up directly from the Hero section.
 * - Motivational Text: Displays bold and inspirational text, formatted for readability across device sizes, to engage users and communicate key messages.
 *
 * Implementation Details:
 * - The component uses the `useEffect` hook to initialize the gradient on the canvas element after the component mounts.
 * - The layout is structured using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness, with specific styles for small (sm) screens and adjustments for medium (md) and large (lg) screens.
 * - The Hero component is divided into several sections:
 *   - A canvas with a dynamic gradient background.
 *   - A sign-up form positioned at the bottom-right of the Hero section, with responsive adjustments for smaller screens.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This component is ideal for landing pages or any section of a website where you want to make a strong visual impact, engage users with motivational text, and provide a direct call to action with a sign-up form.
